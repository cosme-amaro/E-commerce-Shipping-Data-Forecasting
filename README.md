# E-commerce Shipping Data Forecasting for Delayed Shipments

This project focuses on forecasting the likelihood of delays in product shipments for an e-commerce company. The objective is to develop a predictive model for a binary variable that determines whether a product will experience a delay in shipping. By analyzing historical shipping data and relevant factors, such as product type, destination, and shipping method, the project aims to improve shipping efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Key Objectives:
* Develop a predictive model for forecasting delayed shipments.
* Identify key factors influencing shipment delays.
* Provide insights for proactive management of shipping operations to reduce delays.

## Methodology:
1. Data Collection: Gather historical e-commerce shipping data.
2. Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that may affect shipping delays.
3. Model Development: Develop a predictive model, such as logistic regression, random forest, or neural networks, to forecast delayed shipments based on the selected features.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the predictive model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Forecasting: Use the trained model to forecast the likelihood of delays for future shipments.

## Outcome:
The project outcome is to deliver a predictive model that accurately forecasts the likelihood of delays in product shipments. This model will enable the e-commerce company to proactively manage shipping operations, reduce delays, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Impact:
By forecasting delayed shipments, the e-commerce company can improve its shipping efficiency, reduce costs associated with expedited shipping, and enhance customer experience. Additionally, the insights gained from the project can be used to optimize shipping processes and mitigate factors leading to delays, ultimately improving the company's competitiveness in the e-commerce market.
